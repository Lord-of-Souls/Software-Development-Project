# Python Web Development & Cloud Deployment

## Description
This project demonstrates a professional software development workflow for Python. It covers the complete lifecycle of a web application—from setting up an isolated development environment to deploying a live, interactive tool accessible to users worldwide.

## Project's Objective
The goal is to master essential industry tools by building a functional web application using the **Streamlit** framework and successfully hosting it on a cloud platform.

## Results
- **Live Web Application:** A publicly accessible URL where users can interact with the software.
- **Isolated Environment:** A clean, reproducible development setup that prevents dependency conflicts.
- **Successful Cloud Migration:** Transitioned a local Python script into a global service.

## Methodology
The development process followed standard industry best practices as of 2026:
1.  **Environment Isolation:** Created a dedicated Python virtual environment to manage specific package versions.
2.  **Modular Development:** Built the frontend and backend logic simultaneously using Streamlit’s declarative Python-only approach.
3.  **Dependency Management:** Documented all required libraries in a `requirements.txt` file to ensure the cloud environment matches the local setup.
4.  **Continuous Deployment:** Connected the local codebase to a cloud service (such as Streamlit Community Cloud or Google Cloud Run) for automated hosting.

## Utilized Tools
- **Framework:** [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- **Environment Management:** [Python venv](https://docs.python.org) (virtual environments).
- **IDE:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
- **Deployment Platform:** [Render](http://render.com/)

  ## Acquired/Developed Abilities
- **Virtual Environment Management:** Ability to create, activate, and deactivate isolated environments to keep system Python clean.
- **Web App Engineering:** Transforming data scripts into interactive user interfaces without traditional frontend languages.
- **Cloud Literacy:** Understanding deployment pipelines, server ports, and cloud resource management.
- **Dependency Versioning:** Mastering `pip` and requirements files for project reproducibility.

## Upgrades to be Made
- [ ] Add **Secrets Management** for secure API key handling.
- [ ] Implement **CI/CD Actions** via GitHub to auto-deploy on every push.
- [ ] Integrate a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) for user data.
- [ ] Add custom styling using Tailwind CSS or Streamlit Themes.

## How to Run It
You can run the project files in two ways:

### Option 1: Google Colab
1. Upload the `.ipynb` files directly to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Run the cells sequentially.

### Option 2: Local Environment (VS Code)
1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.orgdownloads/) installed.
2. Install the **Jupyter Extension** in VS Code.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file and select your Python interpreter.
